Icinga Web 2 Training Module
============================

This module has been used in multiple trainings by [Netways GmbH](https://www.netways.de).
Structured as a step by step hands-on workshop it wants to get you started
with writing Icinga Web 2 modules. The latest version is hosted at [git.netways.org](https://git.netways.org/icingaweb2-modules/icingaweb2-module-training).

As of this writing there is only a German version available: [Icinga Web 2 erweitern](doc/icinga-web-2-erweitern.md).
Nobody wrote an English translation yet. So if you want to help us with this
task please let us know. We'd love to publish this in an English version on [icinga.org](https://www.icinga.org).
